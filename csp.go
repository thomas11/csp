// The examples from Tony Hoare's seminal 1978 paper "Communicating
// sequential processes" implemented in Go.
//
// Go's design was strongly influenced by Hoare's paper [1]. Although
// Go differs significantly from the example language used in the
// paper, the examples still translate rather easily. The biggest
// difference apart from syntax is that Go models the conduits of
// concurrent communication explicitly as channels, while the
// processes of Hoare's language send messages directly to each other,
// similar to Erlang. Hoare hints at this possibility in section 7.3,
// but with the limitation that "each port is connected to exactly one
// other port in another process", in which case it would be a mostly
// syntactic difference.
//
// [1]
// http://blog.golang.org/2010/07/share-memory-by-communicating.html
//
// Implementing these examples, and the careful reading of the paper
// required to do so, were a very enlightening experience. I found the
// iterative array of 4.2, the concurrent routines changing their
// behavior execution of 4.5, and the highly concurrent matrix
// multiplication of 6.2 to be particularly interesting.
//
// I tried to name routines and variables like in the paper, which
// explains the now outdated upper-case names. Similarly, I tried to
// make the function signatures as similar to the paper as possible,
// so we mostly work directly with channels, where one would hide this
// implementation detail in real-world code.
//
// The ugly name prefixes like "S33_" make godoc order the types by
// section of the paper.
//
// Most of the examples have tests, although I have not taken a lot of
// care to test corner cases. The test of the S53_DiningPhilosophers
// is not really a test, it simply runs the routine for ten seconds so
// you can observe the philosophers behavior (use `go test -v`).

// 4.2 Recursion: Factorial

// This example is fascinating. It introduces the "iterative array" which
// kept me puzzled for a while, but made for a great a-ha moment when I got
// it. It's an array of coroutines, so that for a given integer input i,
// the coroutine at index i knows how to deal with it. By addressing its
// neighbor coroutines at i-1 and i+1, a coroutine can communicate with the
// others to break down the overall problem. That sounds pretty abstract
// and will be clearer in the following examples.
//
// To compute n!, we use the simple recurrence `n! = n * (n-1)!`, with `0!
// = 1! = 1`. In our iterative array of goroutines, when routine i receives
// the value x, it sends x-1 up the chain, i.e., to the right in the
// iterative array. This continues until the value is 0 or 1 and we hit the
// base case of the recursion. The coroutines then pass values back down
// the chain, i.e. leftwards, starting with 1. When routine i receives a
// result passed back down the chain, it multiplies it with x and passes on
// the result. When it arrives at routine 0, n! is computed.
//
// The caller doesn't see this process. We only need to expose goroutine 0,
// which can compute any factorial by passing the value up the chain and
// waiting for the result. Any factorial up to the limit of the length of
// the iterative array, that is, which has to be given when creating the
// factorial iterative array.
//
// Go models communication between goroutines with explicit channel values,
// so in this implementation the iterative array is an array of channels.
// When we create it, we launch the corresponding goroutines at the same
// time.
